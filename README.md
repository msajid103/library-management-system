# Library-management-system
# Website (front_end/back_end)
We had done a Library Management System by using three different languages: Html, CSS and Javascript. We created a website to make this software user-friendly.
Basically, we created two html files: index.html and user.html. 
The index.html is the Home page file of the website and user.html is processed when end_user tries to login.
